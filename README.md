### Reflection 1
In this tutorial, I have implemented several clean code methods. Here are the following methods.
1. **Descriptive Names**
    
    I used descriptive variable and function names.
2. **Avoiding Redundant Comments**

    I avoided writing redundant comments. I tried to depend on how descriptive my codes are instead of using too many comments.
3. **Multiple Git Branches**

    I used different branches to separate different features. These branches are meant to make my work more organized.
4. **Useful Commits**

    I always tried to commit everytime I made a change. This is so I can keep the history of my work. 

By the time I finished Excercise 1, I have not implemented any secure code methods. Therefore, secure coding is one of the aspects I can improve for my work. I might add authorization and authentication methods for my web application in the future.
